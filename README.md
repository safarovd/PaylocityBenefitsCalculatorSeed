# What is this?

A project seed containing a React app ("app") with a C# dotnet API ("PaylocityBenefitsCalculator").  It is meant to get you started on the Paylocity Coding Challenge by taking some initial setup decisions away.

The goal is to respect your time, avoid live coding, and get a sense for how you work.

# Coding Challenge

**Show us how you work.**

Each of our Paylocity product teams operates like a small startup, empowered to deliver business value in
whatever way they see fit. Because our teams are close knit and fast moving it is imperative that you are able
to work collaboratively with your fellow developers. 

This coding challenge is designed to allow you to demonstrate your abilities and discuss your approach to
design and implementation with your potential colleagues. You are free to use whatever technologies you
prefer but please be prepared to discuss the choices you’ve made. We encourage you to focus on creating a
logical and functional solution rather than one that is completely polished and ready for production.

The challenge can be used as a canvas to capture your strengths in addition to reflecting your overall coding
standards and approach. There’s no right or wrong answer.  It’s more about how you think through the
problem. We’re looking to see your skills in all three tiers so the solution can be used as a conversation piece
to show our teams your abilities across the board.

Requirements will be given separately.

# Interviewee Notes:

This application should work out of the box. A few 3rd party packages were installed, but they are well known 
and supported so I doubt they'll cause any issues. For reference here is a simple UML Diagram of the backend 
code:

Please let me know if you have any questions.
